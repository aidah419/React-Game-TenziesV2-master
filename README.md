# React Game - TenziesV2

Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls.

Just open index.html and have fun =)

The winning condition is to hold 10 same numbers so I added a ”Roll” button that generates an array of 10
numbers on dice that can be held and when the player has won they receive confetti and a ”New Game” button
by using the React framework.

More functions in progress
